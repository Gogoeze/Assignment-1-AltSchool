    <h1>About myself</h1>
    <h3 id="Biography">Biography</h3>
    <p>
      AltSchool ID- ALT/SOE/024/6058.<br>
      My name is Ugomma EzeOgali, and I was born in December 2003 in Abia State,
      Nigeria. I come from a Christian family, and my upbringing was deeply
      rooted in faith and values that continue to shape my life today. From a
      young age, I learned the importance of being independent, believing in
      myself, and helping those around me. My educational journey began at
      Wisdom International School, where I completed my primary education. I
      later attended Our Senior Girls Secondary School, which laid the
      foundation for my academic pursuits. In 2024, I graduated from Gregory
      University Uturu with a degree in computer engineering, a milestone I am
      incredibly proud of. During my time at university, I completed my
      Industrial Training (IT), which sparked my interest in software
      engineering—a field I am currently exploring with great passion. Beyond
      academics, I have always had a love for singing and reading. Singing, in
      particular, is a source of joy for me, and I hope to join a choir someday
      to nurture this passion. My friends and family often describe me as very
      active, and I strive to live up to that by staying engaged and committed
      to my goals. Looking ahead, I am determined to further my education by
      pursuing a master's and PhD. My dreams extend beyond my career—I aspire to
      build a traditional, wealthy home, marry right, and raise children in an
      environment where God is at the center of our lives. While I don’t have a
      personal motto, my faith guides me, reminding me to remain steadfast in
      all I do. This journey is just the beginning, and I am excited to see what
      the future holds as I continue to grow, learn, and make an impact in the
      world.

    <h3 id="altschool_program">Why i joined the AltSchool Program</h3>
    <p>
      During my industrial training in my 400 level at university, I had the
      opportunity to work at an innovation company. This experience introduced
      me to the world of software engineering and marked a turning point in my
      career interests. I was especially drawn to front-end development, where I
      discovered the joy of bringing designs to life using CSS. It was
      fulfilling to see how creativity and technology could merge to create
      functional and visually appealing solutions. Beyond my interest, I also
      see software engineering as a field that offers vast opportunities for
      growth and financial independence. I chose to join AltSchool because it is
      an avenue to develop practical skills, gain real-world experience, and
      build a strong foundation in software engineering. The program's structure
      and emphasis on hands-on learning align perfectly with my goals.

    <h3 id="goals">My goals for the school of software engineering</h3>
    <p>
      My primary goal for this program is to become a fully developed software
      engineer, with a strong focus on front-end development. By the end of this
      journey, I aim to: 1. Master Front-End Development: Enhance my expertise
      in building responsive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing
      interfaces. 2. Broaden My Technical Skills: Gain a comprehensive
      understanding of software engineering principles, tools, and frameworks.
      3. Build Real-World Projects: Apply my knowledge to develop practical
      solutions that can solve real-life problems. 4. Grow as a Professional:
      Develop the confidence and competence to contribute effectively in the
      software engineering industry. Ultimately, I want to emerge from this
      program as a well-rounded professional, ready to make an impact in the
      tech world while pursuing my passion for front-end development.
